## Description
A visual novel-esque mini-game. Using the skills learned in Programming for Digital Arts, the player will be able to make choices and have them affect the game's outcome.

## Features
- #1 player will be able to make decisions that have long lasting affects in the game.
	- The player will be given various responses they can say to the characters in-game, after selcting one it will be saved. This will be done through creating 'flags' to mark whether or not ( if True/False) a paramater was met.
- #2 Different sprites are displayed to show in-game character's emotions. 
	- Creating a method to change out a sprite for a new one.
- #3 2-3 Different endings
	- In tandem with the 'long lasting affects' of decisions being made, there also will be different endings in the game. This will be done through attributing certain flags to certain endings and then creating a method to calculate which ending's flags the player collected the most of.

## Challenges
- Need to research if there are any PIP repositries that set the groundwork for this type of program (displaying png images and text)
- Learn how to display text and images in a clean format (having things like a text box plus character names displayed)
- Short sentence of any skill or topic that needs to be learnt or researched.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Ideal outcome would include 2-3 seperate endings and have a variety of different sprites for characters. Plus background art. Maybe.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare essential outcome would have at least 3 sprites for each character and 2 endings. Probably not as much of a polished feel.
